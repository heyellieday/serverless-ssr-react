# serverless-ssr-react
Exploring SSR React apps with AWS Lambdas and Serverless framework. How ironic.

This is a work in progress. I wouldn't currently use it for anything important, but feel free to take a look to learn some things :)

## Local Setup

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

## Running tests

1. `npm run test`

## Deploying to Production

The exact steps needed to deploy to production are currently in flux.

Apps using this setup are meant to be deployed on AWS using the Serverless Framework. Currently, you can deploy automatically when a CircleCI build succeeds when your CI account is properly configured. (Setup steps to be added soon)
